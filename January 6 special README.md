There are two files: one with  along name ("Linear... chain") and the other one with a short name "Cable summary". Go for "Cable summary". The file with the long name is a 200-page-long manuscript that is so long because it gives all the intermediate calculations; despite its length, the explanations given in it can be sometimes difficult to understand. "Cable summary" is a rewritten version of the full computational essay; it is about four times shorter because it omits the unnecessary details. In addition, in the process of re-writing, the explanations given there have been improved, so now it's easier to understand than "Linear... chain".
