Welcome to the GitHub page of the project "Linear undamped oscillations of a hanging cable and a discrete chain"!

The repository has several branches. "main" doesn't contain anything but readme.
The other branches are named as "06012021", which stands for January 6th 2021. The branch "06012021" contains the January 6th 2021 version of the project.
The January 13th version is only slightly different from the January 6th version in that it's a bit better polished. The February 16th version uses piecewise Frobenius method, which allows to improve the accuracy of numerical calculations, and it also features an updated abstract.
