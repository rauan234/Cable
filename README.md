Welcome to the GitHub page of the project "Linear undamped oscillations of a hanging cable and a discrete chain"!

The repository has several branches. The "main" branch doesn't contain anything but readme.
The other branches are named as "6_Jan_2021", and this of course stands for January 6th 2021. The idea is that a branch "6_Jan_2021" contains the version
of the project as of by January 6th 2021.
