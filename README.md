In this old high school project, I study the small oscillations of a catenary cable. By using hyperbolic curvilinear coordinates, I find that the oscillations of the cable are described by a PDE that is fourth-order in position, second-order in time. The derivation of the PDE is theoretical but its study is largely numerical. I also study the oscillations of a chain of finitely many links and numerically observe that as the number of links tends to infinity, the oscillations of the chain converge to those of a catenary cable. My results agree with those of John Gregg Gale's 1976 master's thesis, which also investigated the small oscillations of a catenary cable but used different methods.

The repository has several branches. The code is not in "main" but in other branches. Each code branch is named according to its creation date, so that "06012021" contains the January 6th 2021 version of the project.

2026 UPDATE: My writing skills at the time of conducting this project were very limited. To partially convey the contents of the project, I decided to include into the "main" branch a few excerpt screenshots from the project. The screenshots are from the Mathematica notebook "Cable 4.nb" from the branch "16022021".
