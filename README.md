In this high school project, I study the small oscillations of a catenary cable. By using hyperbolic curvilinear coordinates, I find that the oscillations of the cable are described by a PDE that is fourth-order in position, second-order in time. The derivation of the PDE is theoretical but its study is largely numerical. I also study the oscillations of a chain of finitely many links and numerically observe that as the number of links tends to infinity, the oscillations of the chain converge to those of a catenary cable. My writing skills at the time were limited, so I decided include a few excerpt screenshots from "Cable 4.nb" in this repository.

The repository has several branches. "main" doesn't contain anything but readme.
The other branches are named in the format "06012021", which stands for January 6th 2021. The branch "06012021" contains the January 6th 2021 version of the project.
